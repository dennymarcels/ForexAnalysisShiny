# ForexAnalysisShiny

Although MyFxBook is a great tool for traders willing to evaluate account performance, comparing metrics is very tiresome and inefficient. The UI allows very limited side-by-side comparison, and filters applied to dates, Magic Numbers or symbols cannot be saved or carried to other browser tabs. 

This repository contains code to run a Shiny App, which generates more comprehensive trade summaries for MyFxBook accounts. You can compare several accounts with multiple filters applied at the same time.

The app is hosted at https://dennymc.shinyapps.io/ForexAnalysis/. Updated Instructions to use can be found there.
